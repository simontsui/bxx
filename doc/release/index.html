        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            <span class="term">BXX</span> specifies and implements a binary data formats for structured hierarchical,
            <code>XML</code> like, data. The initial driver for the project is to serialize internal data structure of
            an application for fast startup. <span class="term">BXD</span> is name of the binary date format. It is
            designed to has structure very similar to XML. It use tags and attributes to store data. It is a design
            goal to allow loss-less conversion to and from XML. However, the goal is not to replace XML. While XML is
            good for textual data, BXD is designed for binary data. The binary format allow non-textual data to be
            processed more efficiently. A number of basic data types allow value to be written and read efficiently
            without having to convert everything to and from string. Attribute and text value can be stored by value,
            or by reference to string (<code>UTF-8</code>) and blob (<code>byte[]</code>). All tag and attribute names
            are interned to allow efficient storage and processing.
